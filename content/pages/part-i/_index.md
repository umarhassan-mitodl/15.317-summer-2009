Overview
--------

Part I of this course is the beginning of a two-year LGO leadership journey. The LGO leadership curriculum is hands-on experience that blends theory and practice. The entire leadership curriculum is integrated and woven into the fabric of the entire two year program. The design is based on the principles of first reflecting on prior leadership experiences and then applying lessons learned to further develop your leadership capabilities. The summer session provides a grounding in leadership theories and frameworks. Each class will be action oriented and highly interactive. We will explore alternative approaches to leadership, compare and contrast various leadership styles, and look at a range of leadership tasks/processes.
