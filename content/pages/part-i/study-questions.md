Leadership, ethics, and authority (Leigh Hafrey)
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}

3.  How would you describe Diana's power, in Britain and around the world?
4.  Have you encountered people like Sir Thomas More—or Henry VIII, or Cromwell, or Rich—in your work? How do they function as colleagues? What is their sense of their profession?
5.  Can one speak of multiple spheres in the world Bolt portrays in _A Man for All Seasons_? If so, does each have its own rules or morals, or do the inhabitants of all of them apply the same standards to their behavior?
6.  "Affection goes as deep in me as you think, but only God is love right through, Howard; and that's myself (p. 122)." What is a "self" in Bolt's play, and what roles does it play for all of us in society and in our organizations?
