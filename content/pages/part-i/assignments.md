A grade for the course will be assigned after the completion of all portions of 15.317. However, class participation and the following summer deliverables are components of the final grade:

### Team-based

1.  Mid-summer peer team feedback and cross-team sharing.
2.  Group assessment of leadership and team performance paper.

### Individual

1.  Personal leadership reflection and development paper.

Personal Leadership Paper
-------------------------

Length: 4-5 pages double-spaced

The purposes of this assignment are:

*   Reflection on what leadership means to you personally.
*   Identification of where your passion lies and the legacy you would like to leave behind from your two years in LGO.
*   Begin to formulate a project that will help you achieve your goals and objectives.

This paper will document your personal views on what leadership means to you and what specific leadership competencies you want to personally develop over your time in LGO. Your plan to develop these competencies should include working on a project that you feel passionate about and will leave your personal legacy at LGO. The project can involve the LGO program, MIT, or the community at large.

Peer Team Feedback and Cross-Team Sharing

Group Assessment of Leadership & Team Performance
-------------------------------------------------

Length: 5-6 pages double-spaced

The purposes of this assignment are:

*   Apply the readings on teams and leadership to the analysis of your summer team.
*   Trace the evolution of your summer team.
*   Analyze the group processes and leadership styles in your team.
*   Evaluate your team's performance.
*   Suggest actions to improve performance in future teams you form/join.

### Step 1: Collect data.

Before any analysis can be done, it is necessary to have some data as to what has gone on in your team. Data can come from several sources. You can keep notes during the meetings, documenting what is going on and how you are interpreting what is going on. You can tape record one or more of your meetings. You might do a socio-gram of a team meeting.

### Step 2: Analyze the team's internal process.

In analyzing the team, use all the data available and back up your points. You should provide a dynamic view of your team's development. How did the group get started? What effect did this beginning have? What were critical events that shaped how the group has evolved? How would you characterize the group at this point in time? What is your prediction about the future? Your analysis should take into account the readings from the class.

### Step 3: Evaluate your group performance and suggest ways to improve.

How would you assess the performance of your group? Be explicit on the performance criteria you use and the data used to make your assessments. What lessons do you take away from this group experience that you can use to improve the performance of future groups in which you will participate at Sloan and in your future working environments?
